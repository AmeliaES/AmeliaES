### A research fellow in psychiatry, an advocator of good coding practices and an aspiring software developer/tester.

## Projects from my PhD/post-doc:
- Created an [R package (with test coverage report)](https://github.com/AmeliaES/susiexR) which formats and plots output from a [specialised genetic software](https://github.com/getian107/SuSiEx).
- Developed an [R Shiny app](https://github.com/TIDAL-modelling/TIDAL) for modelling longitudinal data, during a 6 month PhD secondment.
- [Cleaned electronic health record data with SQL](https://github.com/AmeliaES/SAIL)
- Published first author papers ([2025_EurPsych](https://github.com/AmeliaES/2025_EurPsych) and [ALSPAC_inflam_2022](https://github.com/AmeliaES/ALSPAC_inflam_2022)) applying epidemiological and statistical methods for mental health research.

## Helping others to code with best practices:
- Materials I developed for a [code review workshop](https://github.com/AmeliaES/code-review-workshop) with funding won from [The Improving Research Community Builder Award](https://www.orben.group/improving-research-community-builder-award).
- A [coding club](https://github.com/ccbs-stradl/coding_club/tree/main) that I set up and run in our research group.
- Co-produced materials for a webinar on [git and GitHub](https://github.com/TheDataLabScotland/tdl-academy-git-intro) for [The Data Lab Scotland](https://thedatalab.com/).

## Curious to learn new coding languages and skills:
- [My first PHP/MySQL CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) application](https://github.com/AmeliaES/eCommerce-admin-panel)
- [My first raspberry pi project, connecting to Lothian Bus API and displaying when the next bus is on a raspberry pi](https://github.com/AmeliaES/raspberry-pi-bus-tracker)
- [Created a basic website with JS, bootstrap, html, CS](https://github.com/AmeliaES/CodeSpace-Portfolio)
- [Made a personal spotify history dashboard using Python and Dash](https://github.com/AmeliaES/spotify_dashboard)
- [Scraped a car sales website using Selenium and Python](https://github.com/AmeliaES/cars)
- [Data visualisation of my FitBit data](https://github.com/AmeliaES/fitbitr)
- GitHub pages websites I've built: [personal website](https://github.com/AmeliaES/ameliaes.github.io), [colleague's website](https://github.com/Life-Epi-Psych/Life-Epi-Psych.github.io) and [software documentation website](https://github.com/TIDAL-modelling/TIDAL-modelling.github.io).
