I'm currently finishing a PhD in Translational Neuroscience funded by the Wellcome Trust at the University of Edinburgh, Scotland. 

I have recently started a post-doc job with Prof Andrew McIntosh working on the AMBER (Antidepressant Medications: Biology, Exposure & Response) project. This is a project investigating the causal mechanisms of antidepressant exposure and response.
