I am a Post-Doctoral Research Fellow with Prof Andrew McIntosh working on the AMBER (Antidepressant Medications: Biology, Exposure & Response) project. This is a project investigating the causal mechanisms of antidepressant exposure and response.

I previously completed a PhD in Translational Neuroscience at the University of Edinburgh, Scotland.
